# From Figma to Frontend

This project is a simple gallery showcasing the challenges from Rocketseat's Discover path. The goal is to practice and apply the frontend development process from start to finish, starting with the provided Figma designs and then implementing them using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks.

## Overview

The Discover path from Rocketseat offers a series of challenges for frontend developers, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each challenge comes with its own Figma design, which serves as a visual reference for implementing the frontend components and layout.

This gallery project aims to expose all the challenges, allowing you to navigate through them and visualize the final results. By practicing these challenges, I will gain hands-on experience translating design mockups into functional web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Gallery view of all Discover challenges
- Navigation to individual challenges
- Display of challenge details and Figma designs
- Implementation of challenges using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Folder Structure

The project follows a folder structure where each challenge has its own dedicated folder. Within each challenge folder, you will find the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file representing the challenge's web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles specific to the challenge.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing any custom code for the challenge.

## Prerequisites
